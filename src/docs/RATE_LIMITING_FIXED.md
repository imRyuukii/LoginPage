# Rate Limiting - Bug Fix Summary

**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🐛 Problem

Rate limiting was counting down attempts (5, 4, 3, 2, 1) but NOT blocking after the 5th attempt. 
Users could keep trying to log in indefinitely.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

**Timezone mismatch between PHP and MySQL:**

When PHP calculated `blocked_until` using:
```php
$blockedUntil = date('Y-m-d H:i:s', strtotime('+30 minutes'));
```

It was using PHP's timezone, but MySQL was using its own timezone. This caused the 
`blocked_until` timestamp to be in the PAST, so the block never took effect.

**Example from database:**
```
NOW() = 2025-10-18 00:15:49
blocked_until = 2025-10-17 22:28:26  ← This is in the past!
```

---

## ✅ Solution

**Use MySQL's native date functions instead of PHP's strtotime:**

### Before (BROKEN):
```php
$blockedUntil = date('Y-m-d H:i:s', strtotime('+30 minutes'));
$db->query("UPDATE rate_limits SET blocked_until = ?", [$blockedUntil]);
```

### After (FIXED):
```php
$db->query("UPDATE rate_limits 
            SET blocked_until = DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL ? MINUTE)",
            [$minutes]);
```

This ensures the timestamp is calculated entirely within MySQL, eliminating timezone issues.

## 🔧 Files Fixed

1. **src/app/services/RateLimiter.php**
   - Changed `blockIp()` to use `DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL ? MINUTE)`
   - Changed `isBlocked()` to use `DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL ? MINUTE)`
   - Changed `recordAttempt()` to use `DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL ? MINUTE)`
   - Changed `getRemainingAttempts()` to use `DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL ? MINUTE)`
   - Made `getClientIp()` public for debugging

## ✅ How It Works Now

### Login Attempts:
1. **Attempt 1-4:** Shows "Invalid login or password"
2. **Attempt 5:** Shows "Invalid login or password. 0 attempt(s) remaining before lockout"
3. **Attempt 6+:** **BLOCKED** - Shows "Too many login attempts. Please try again in 30 minutes."

### During Block Period:
- Login button disabled
- Form inputs disabled
- Shows exact time remaining: "Try again in 29 minutes"

### After 30 Minutes:
- Block automatically expires
- User can try again (5 new attempts)

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test via CLI:
```bash
php test-rate-limit.php
```

### Test via Web:
Visit: `http://localhost/LoginPage/src/app/test-login-rate-limit.php`

This shows:
- Your current IP address
- Current block status
- Attempts remaining
- Database records with timestamps

### Test via Login Page:
1. Go to login page
2. Enter wrong password 5 times
3. On 5th attempt, you'll be blocked immediately
4. Try to login again → form is disabled with "Locked" button

## 📊 Rate Limits

| Action | Max Attempts | Time Window | Block Duration |
|--------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Login | 5 | 15 minutes | 30 minutes |
| Register | 3 | 60 minutes | 60 minutes |
| Password Reset | 3 | 60 minutes | 60 minutes |
| Resend Verification | 5 | 60 minutes | 30 minutes |

## 🗄️ Database

**Check rate limits:**
```sql
SELECT ip_address, action, attempts, last_attempt, blocked_until,
       TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, NOW(), blocked_until) as minutes_left
FROM rate_limits 
WHERE action='login'
ORDER BY last_attempt DESC;
```

**Clear all rate limits (for testing):**
```sql
DELETE FROM rate_limits WHERE ip_address != '__SYSTEM__';
```

**Manually unblock an IP:**
```sql
UPDATE rate_limits 
SET blocked_until = NULL 
WHERE ip_address = 'YOUR_IP' AND action = 'login';
```

## 🎯 What Changed in the Fix

### 1. Time Calculation (Most Important)
- ❌ **OLD:** PHP calculates timestamp → MySQL stores it (timezone mismatch)
- ✅ **NEW:** MySQL calculates timestamp using its own NOW() function

### 2. Window Checking
- ❌ **OLD:** `WHERE last_attempt >= '2025-10-17 23:45:00'` (PHP calculated)
- ✅ **NEW:** `WHERE last_attempt >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 15 MINUTE)` (MySQL calculated)

### 3. Blocking Logic
- ❌ **OLD:** `SET blocked_until = '2025-10-17 22:28:26'` (Wrong timezone!)
- ✅ **NEW:** `SET blocked_until = DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 MINUTE)` (Correct!)

## 🔒 Security Benefits

✅ **Prevents brute force attacks** - Attackers can only try 5 passwords per 30 minutes  
✅ **Prevents spam registrations** - Max 3 accounts per hour per IP  
✅ **Prevents password reset abuse** - Max 3 reset requests per hour  
✅ **Prevents email flooding** - Max 5 verification emails per hour

## 🐞 Debugging Tips

### If blocking still doesn't work:

1. **Check your IP address:**
```php
$limiter = new RateLimiter();
echo $limiter->getClientIp(); // Should show your real IP
```

2. **Check database timezone:**
```sql
SELECT NOW(), @@global.time_zone, @@session.time_zone;
```

3. **Check rate limit records:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM rate_limits 
WHERE ip_address = 'YOUR_IP' 
AND action = 'login';
```

4. **Enable error logging:**
Check your PHP error logs for any RateLimiter errors.
