#### User Roles & Permissions
- Add more roles (moderator, editor, etc.) :
    1. Add More Roles (moderator, editor, etc.)
    What it does: Instead of just "admin" and "user", create multiple role levels:
    •  Super Admin - full system access, can manage other admins
    •  Admin - user management, system settings
    •  Moderator - can manage users but not system settings
    •  Editor - can edit content but not manage users
    •  Premium User - regular user with extra features
    •  Basic User - standard limited access
    •  Guest - temporary/limited access

    Example: A moderator can ban problematic users and delete inappropriate content, 
    but can't access server settings or billing information.
- Granular permissions system : 
    What it does: Fine-tune exactly what each role can do:
    •  Permission categories:
        ◦  User management (create, edit, delete users)
        ◦  Content management (create, edit, delete posts/content)
        ◦  System settings (database, security settings)
        ◦  Financial access (billing, payments)
        ◦  Analytics access (view reports, export data)
    •  Individual permissions that can be mixed and matched
    •  Custom role creation - build roles with specific permission combinations

    Example: Create a "Customer Support" role that can view user profiles 
    and reset passwords, but can't delete users or access financial data.
